# List application in React

This is an exercise developed for Module 13 of MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp

This project is a simple exercise in using the fundamentals of React components and state management to create a functional todo list. (As a foodie, naturally, I made it into a "to eat" list. ðŸ¥‘)
